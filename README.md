# SATE2019
We have created this repository to place our resources (dot models, smv models, png figures, source code, etc.) created during formal analyis of Java libraries.
In our experimentation, we combine the strengths of two state-of-the-art techniques i.e., Model Learning and Model Checking.
In our our experimentation, we used LearnLib to learn the models of SUL considerd as black-box.
After learning the models, we formally analyze the models by using NuSMV model checker.
