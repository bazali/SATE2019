Our processing system consist of Processor corei5 with 8GM Ram.
We use GVEdit tool to visulaize dot models and then save them in png format. 
GVEdit takes too much time to draw models of large size dot models.
We only draw the models for Set size of upto six enteries. However, we have 
provided dot  models of large size (complex models with large states) which
can be visulaized by some higher specs machine.
